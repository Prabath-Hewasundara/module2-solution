                    First developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language. 
                    HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed 
                    on the World Wide Web. 
                    Without HTML, a browser would not know how to display text as elements or load images or
                    other elements.

                    CSS. Stands for "Cascading Style Sheet." Cascading style sheets are used to format the 
                    layout of Web pages. They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other 
                    aspects of Web pages that previously could only be defined in a page's HTML.

                    JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. 
                    It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, 
                    whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user 
                    and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented 
                    capabilities.
